# Some differential equations in R

One of the simplest equations describing population growth is the logistic equation. This
equation models the density changes of one species (y) in an environment where
competition for available resources reduces population growth at high densities, and
eventually leads to negative growth above a specific carrying capacity K. At very
low density, the absence of competition allows exponential growth, at a growth rate
r > 0:
